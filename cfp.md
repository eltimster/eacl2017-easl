EACL 2017 Workshop on Symbolic and Deep Learning Approaches to the Analysis of Evaluative, Affective, and Subjective Language (EASL 2017)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Description

We invite the NLP research community to explore approaches going beyond bag of words and bag of sentences by combining higher level linguistic insights including discourse level information, pragmatics and other contextual information along with statistical data driven techniques, for better understanding of EAS text.  Approaches which explore linguistic phenomena such as figurative language, intent detection as well as the use of extra-linguistic information in terms of the socio-cultural origins of the text, social network structure origins of the text, and author social network profiles in understanding EAS text would also be of interest. We are also interested in non-trivial EAS text applications which go beyond mere identification of evaluative, emotive, subjective cue phrases to underlying causative events/reasons/arguments which give rise to these emotions/feelings/beliefs/subjective opinions. Non-trivial benchmarks for comparing machine comprehension of EAS aspects with human understanding would also be welcome. 

Topics of interest include but not limited to the following:
•	Richer and deeper linguistic representations of EAS aspects of text
•	Comparing & combining deep learning and linguistic approaches for EAS text analysis
•	Non-trivial benchmarks for EAS text analysis
•	Figurative language detection, Intent detection, stance detection in EAS text
•	Interpretability of deep learning based EAS text analysis systems
•	Identifying origins/dynamic contexts/causative events/reasons in EAS text analysis  
•	Understanding the human brain processing of EAS language
•	Extra-linguistic aspects in EAS language understanding
•	Socio-cultural aspects of EAS language analysis
•	Psycho-linguistic aspects of EAS text analysis
