### Submissions

Both long and short papers must follow the [two-column format of EACL
2017](http://eacl2017.org/index.php/calls/call-for-papers). For the original
submission, long papers may be up to eight (8) pages in length plus unlimited
pages of references, whereas short papers may be up to four (4) pages in
length plus unlimited pages of references. Both long and short papers will be
given one additional page of content for the camera-ready version.

Papers will be presented orally or as posters, as determined by the program committee. The decisions as to which papers will be presented orally and which as posters will be based on the nature rather than the quality of the work. There will be no distinction in the proceedings between papers presented orally and as posters.

As the reviewing will be blind, papers must not include authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the author's identity, e.g., "We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ..." must be avoided. Instead, use citations such as "Smith (1991) previously showed ..." Papers that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review.

Papers that have only appeared on preprint servers such as [arXiv.org](arXiv.org), do not count as previously published, and may be submitted to the workshop. Note that the version submitted for review must be suitably anonymized, and should not contain references to the prior non-archival version.
